        &mdash;Qui-Gon Jinn
        <br>

        "In the 1,526 singles matches I played in my career, I won almost 80%. What percentage of the points do you think I won in those matches? Only 54%."

        <br>
        &mdash;The Apostle Paul

        <br>
        "Our politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death."
        <br>
        &mdash;Neil Postman

        <br>
        "There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations&mdash;these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit&mdash;immortal horrors or everlasting splendors. This does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn. We must play. But our merriment must be of that kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously&mdash;no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption."
        <br>
        &mdash;CS Lewis
        <br>
        <br>
