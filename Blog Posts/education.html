  In education, the medium really is the message. 
</p>

<p class="body">
    Recently, I had a conversation with a teacher I deeply respect. I mentioned how I enjoyed his class a lot, but I was frustrated by the similar class taught by a different teacher. He pointed out—correctly—that the content in both classes was relatively similar. It was just conveyed differently. 
<br>
    What I realized: I liked the content when it was presented in the way I liked. (For me, that looks like a high proportion of time in discussion compared to lecture.)
<br>
    In other words, even though the message of both classes was the same, I my responses were wildly different because of the presentation of the class—the medium. 
<br>
    Broadly, I find it interesting how our classroom experience depends little on content. At least for me, people (teachers, students) and processes (grading, activities) shape my opinion of a class. I think that's one reason (of many!) that great teachers are transformational.
